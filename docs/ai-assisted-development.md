## Conversation Patterns

Typical conversation flows between users and AI assistants:

### Site Creation Conversation

```
User: "I want to create a website for my handmade jewelry business."

AI: "I'd be happy to help you create a website for your handmade jewelry business using Marquita. Let's start by gathering some basic information:

1. What's the name of your business?
2. Where are you located? (This helps with regional payment setup)
3. Do you already have a domain name?
4. Would you primarily be selling products online, or is this more of a portfolio site?"

User: "My business is called 'Gemstone Creations'. I'm in Brazil. I don't have a domain yet. I want to sell my jewelry online."

AI: "Great! Gemstone Creations sounds perfect for an e-commerce site. Since you're in Brazil, we'll set up with Pix and other Brazilian payment methods.

I recommend the e-commerce template for your jewelry business. This will give you:
- A product catalog to showcase your jewelry
- Shopping cart functionality
- Secure checkout with Brazilian payment methods
- Order management
- Mobile-responsive design

Would you like to proceed with creating this site?"

User: "Yes, that sounds perfect!"

AI: [Creates repository from e-commerce template]
"I've created your website repository! Now let's customize it for Gemstone Creations..."
```

### Content Update Conversation

```
User: "I need to update my homepage to announce our summer collection."

AI: "I'd be happy to help you update your homepage to announce your summer collection. Looking at your current site, I can see several options:

1. Add a banner announcement at the top of the page
2. Update the main hero section with summer collection information
3. Add a new featured products section specifically for the summer items

Which approach would you prefer?"

User: "Let's update the hero section."

AI: "Great choice! The hero section will give your summer collection maximum visibility. 

Tell me about your summer collection - what's special about it? Any specific products you want to highlight? Any promotional offers?"

User: "It's a collection of beach-inspired jewelry using sea glass and pearls. We're offering 15% off for the launch week."

AI: [Updates configuration files and deploys changes]
"I've updated your hero section to showcase your beach-inspired summer collection with sea glass and pearls, including the 15% launch discount. The changes are now live on your site!"
```

### Integration Setup Conversation

```
User: "I need to set up payment processing for my site."

AI: "I'd be happy to help you set up payment processing. I see your business is located in Brazil, so I'll focus on the best options for that region.

For Brazilian e-commerce, I recommend implementing:
1. Pix - For instant, low-fee payments
2. Boleto Banc√°rio - For customers who prefer traditional payment methods
3. Brazilian credit cards with installment options (parcelamento)

Would you like to proceed with this setup?"

User: "Yes, that sounds good. How do I get started?"

AI: "Great! To set up these payment methods, we'll need to:

1. Create accounts with payment processors
2. Configure the Deno API services
3. Update your site configuration
4. Test the payment flow

Let's start with creating the necessary accounts. Do you already have a relationship with a payment processor in Brazil?"

[Conversation continues with step-by-step guidance]

## Implementation Details

### Configuration File Structure

AI agents primarily interact with configuration files rather than modifying code directly. The main configuration files include:

1. **Site Configuration** (`config/site.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Business Name",
     "description": "Business description",
     "logo": "/images/logo.png",
     "contact": {
       "email": "contact@example.com",
       "phone": "+1234567890",
       "address": "123 Main St."
     },
     "social": {
       "instagram": "username",
       "facebook": "pagename"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Theme Configuration** (`config/theme.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "colors": {
       "primary": "#4a6cf7",
       "secondary": "#f9656b",
       "background": "#ffffff",
       "text": "#333333"
     },
     "fonts": {
       "heading": "Montserrat",
       "body": "Open Sans"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Page Content** (`config/content/[page-name].json`):
   ```json
   {
     "hero": {
       "title": "Welcome to our store",
       "subtitle": "Find the perfect items for your lifestyle",
       "image": "/images/hero.jpg",
       "cta": {
         "text": "Shop Now",
         "link": "/products"
       }
     },
     "sections": [
       {
         "type": "featured-products",
         "title": "Featured Products",
         "products": ["prod-1", "prod-2", "prod-3"]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Navigation** (`config/navigation.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "main": [
       {
         "label": "Home",
         "url": "/"
       },
       {
         "label": "Products",
         "url": "/products"
       },
       {
         "label": "About",
         "url": "/about"
       },
       {
         "label": "Contact",
         "url": "/contact"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Products/Services** (`config/products.json`):
   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": "prod-1",
       "name": "Product Name",
       "description": "Product description",
       "price": 99.99,
       "images": ["/images/products/prod-1-1.jpg", "/images/products/prod-1-2.jpg"],
       "categories": ["category-1", "category-2"]
     }
   ]
   ```

### GitHub API Interactions

AI agents use GitHub APIs to perform various operations:

1. **Creating Repositories**:
   ```javascript
   // Create a new repository from template
   createRepository({
     name: "business-website",
     templateOwner: "marquita",
     templateRepo: "ecommerce-template",
     private: false
   });
   ```

2. **Updating Files**:
   ```javascript
   // Update a configuration file
   updateFile({
     repo: "business-website",
     path: "config/site.json",
     content: JSON.stringify(siteConfig, null, 2),
     message: "Update site configuration"
   });
   ```

3. **Triggering Workflows**:
   ```javascript
   // Trigger a deployment workflow
   triggerWorkflow({
     repo: "business-website",
     workflow: "deploy.yml",
     ref: "main"
   });
   ```

### Deno Deploy API Configuration

AI agents help set up and configure the Deno Deploy APIs:

1. **Creating Deno Deploy Projects**:
   ```javascript
   // Create a new Deno Deploy project linked to GitHub repo
   createDenoProject({
     name: "business-api",
     githubRepo: "business-website",
     entrypoint: "api/index.ts"
   });
   ```

2. **Setting Environment Variables**:
   ```javascript
   // Set environment variables for API keys (securely)
   setDenoEnvVars({
     project: "business-api",
     vars: {
       "PAYMENT_API_KEY": "sk_live_...",
       "REGION": "brazil",
       "WEBHOOK_SECRET": "whsec_..."
     }
   });
   ```

## Best Practices for AI Agents

When working with Marquita websites, AI agents should follow these guidelines:

1. **Preserve Structure**: Don't fundamentally alter the template structure
2. **Use Configuration First**: Always prefer updating config files over modifying code
3. **Clear Explanations**: Explain what you're doing in non-technical terms
4. **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Break complex tasks into manageable steps
5. **Visual Preview**: When possible, describe how changes will look
6. **Validate Changes**: Confirm changes are working as expected
7. **Document Actions**: Keep a record of significant changes made
8. **Security Focus**: Never expose API keys or sensitive credentials
9. **Performance Awareness**: Consider the performance impact of changes
10. **Mobile Consideration**: Ensure all changes work well on mobile devices
