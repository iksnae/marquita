# Project Marquita - Architecture Overview

## Core Components

### 1. Static Site Generation

Project Marquita uses modern static site generators to create performant, secure websites that can be hosted on GitHub Pages. Our primary technical choices are:

- **SvelteKit**: For interactive web applications and dynamic content sites
- **Astro**: For content-focused websites with minimal JavaScript needs

Both frameworks support static site generation, which enables deployment to GitHub Pages while maintaining excellent performance and security characteristics.

### 2. API Services Layer

To support dynamic functionality without requiring server infrastructure, Marquita leverages:

- **Deno Deploy**: For serverless API endpoints that handle:
  - Third-party integrations
  - Secure operations
  - Data transformations
  - Authentication

Deno Deploy provides a cost-effective solution with a generous free tier (100K requests/day), making it accessible for entrepreneurs starting their businesses.

### 3. Integration Framework

Marquita provides a modular integration system for connecting to third-party services:

- **Payment Processing**: Region-specific payment gateways (PSE/DaviPlata for Colombia, etc.)
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Product catalog and inventory management
- **Media Hosting**: Image, video, and file storage solutions
- **Analytics**: Visitor tracking and business insights

### 4. AI-Assisted Management

A key differentiator for Marquita is its AI-assisted management capability:

- Natural language interface for site updates
- Automated code generation and deployment
- Content creation and optimization
- SEO recommendations and implementation

## Regional Customization

Marquita is designed to support businesses globally, with specific adaptations for regional requirements:

- **Payment Systems**: Region-specific payment gateways and methods
- **Compliance**: Templates for regional legal requirements (privacy policies, terms of service)
- **Localization**: Multi-language support and regional content templates

## Security Considerations

The architecture prioritizes security through:

- Static site generation (reducing attack surface)
- HTTPS enforcement via GitHub Pages
- API key management through environment variables
- Minimal permission scopes for third-party integrations

## Scalability

The architecture supports scaling from personal projects to growing businesses:

- GitHub Pages provides CDN capabilities for global content delivery
- Deno Deploy scales automatically based on demand
- Integration with professional services as business needs grow
