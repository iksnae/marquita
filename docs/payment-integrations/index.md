# Payment Integrations

## Overview

Project Marquita provides region-specific payment integration modules to help entrepreneurs offer the most appropriate and cost-effective payment options for their target markets. This approach maximizes conversion rates by catering to local preferences while minimizing transaction fees.

## Regional Modules

We currently provide payment integration documentation and implementation guides for the following regions:

- [Colombia](./colombia.md) - PSE (Pago Seguro en Línea) and DaviPlata integration
- [USA](./usa.md) - Credit card, ACH, BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later), and digital wallets
- [Brazil](./brazil.md) - Pix, Boleto Bancário, and installment-based credit card payments

## Integration Architecture

All payment integrations in Project Marquita follow a consistent architecture:

1. **Frontend Components**: UI elements for payment selection and input fields
2. **Configuration System**: JSON-based configuration for API keys and options
3. **Deno Deploy API Layer**: Serverless functions handling payment provider communication
4. **Webhook Handlers**: Endpoints for receiving payment notifications
5. **Security Practices**: Standardized approach to secure handling of payment information

## Implementation Approach

When implementing payment processing for your business, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Target Region**: Select the appropriate regional payment module
2. **Configure Payment Options**: Set up the payment methods most relevant to your business
3. **Deploy API Services**: Use Deno Deploy for the serverless backend
4. **Test Transactions**: Thoroughly test the payment flow using sandbox environments
5. **Go Live**: Transition to production credentials after successful testing

## Security Considerations

All payment integrations must adhere to these security practices:

- Never store sensitive payment data in frontend code
- Use environment variables for all API keys and credentials
- Implement proper webhook signature validation
- Enforce HTTPS for all payment-related communications
- Follow region-specific compliance requirements (PCI DSS, LGPD, etc.)

## Adding New Regions

Project Marquita welcomes contributions for additional regional payment modules. If you'd like to contribute a new region, please:

1. Follow the existing documentation structure
2. Provide implementation details for the most popular local payment methods
3. Include code examples for the Deno Deploy API layer
4. Document the user journey for each payment method
5. Submit a pull request with your documentation

## General Best Practices

Regardless of region, consider these best practices for payment integration:

- Provide clear error messages for payment failures
- Display estimated processing times for non-instant payment methods
- Implement proper logging for troubleshooting
- Design a smooth mobile experience for all payment options
- Create a consistent post-payment experience (receipts, order status, etc.)
